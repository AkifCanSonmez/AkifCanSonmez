## My Recent Project
### Type 1 Diabetes Monitoring 
https://github.com/AkifCanSonmez/Type-1-Diabet-Monitoring

The Type-1-Diabet-Monitoring project is a system for monitoring and managing Type 1 Diabetes. The project includes a mobile app for recording blood glucose levels, insulin doses, and meals, as well as a web app for visualizing the data and providing insights to the user.

The project's GitHub repository contains the source code for web app, as well as documentation and instructions for running the system. The repository also includes a demo video showcasing the system in action.

If you're interested in Type 1 Diabetes management or app development, this project may be a useful resource to check out!
